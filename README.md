# Music React Application

- This is a side project where I am trying to build a Full-Stack app similar to Spotify or Apple Music.

- At the moment, it is just front end and is still work in progress. It works as UI concept, it is recommendable to click in different parts of the site.

- Artist, Music and Upload UI for images.

- It plays song when you click play and skip at the bottom and only works for one Album of Post Malone.

- Finally, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
